# coursera machine learning class exercises

This is the coursera machine learning class exercises done by Jun Wan, as part of the learning. I push it to github so that I can transfer the code between multiple workstations I use. There is no guaranttee of correctness.

Most of the scaffold code is provided by the course, and the copyright belongs to the course owner - cousera.
